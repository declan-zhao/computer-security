- In Q1, pay close attention to what's hex-encoded and what isn't.
  There are some opportunities for skipping the hex-decoding (since
  you can do the comparisons on the hex-encoded strings);  but there
  are some instances where you must be working with the "raw" data.

- For Q2, I will soon run the server, and will post some additional
  information  (notes on confidence intervals --- should be a review
  of your ECE-316 probability and statistics course).

- Q2 must run on ECELinux  (it will be graded on that machine)
  You may still test it on your own computer.

  If testing on ECELinux with your own server, please choose some
  "random" por number (has to be above 1024) --- I will be running
  the "reference" server on port 10458, and you want to choose
  some port that is not in use by some other student.
